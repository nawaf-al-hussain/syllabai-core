/**
 * ResourceContext (CLA contract §1): the server-resolved anchor of "what the
 * learner is looking at". The client NEVER asserts context semantics — it
 * passes opaque references (subject root + topic node id in step 1) and the
 * server resolves them fail-closed ({@link ClaContextResolver}).
 *
 * <p>Binding rules (contract §1): resolution is server-side and fail-closed
 * (unresolvable = 4xx, never a best-effort guess); the validation state is
 * resolved server-side and gates evidence assembly; contexts are
 * per-request and stateless — the CLA keeps no server-side hidden session
 * memory.</p>
